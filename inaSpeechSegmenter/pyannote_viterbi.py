Constrained Viterbi Decoding Module
------------------------------------
This module implements a constrained version of the Viterbi algorithm, which is used to decode the most probable 
state sequence from a sequence of observations given emission, transition, and (optionally) initial probabilities. 

Key features include:
- Handling of minimum consecutive state constraints:certain states may be required to persist for a minimum number 
  of consecutive frames. This is achieved by duplicating states and updating the transition, initial, emission, and 
  constraint matrices accordingly.
- Incorporation of state-level constraints: states can be forced (mandatory) or forbidden at specific time steps.
- Log-domain probability computations: All probabilities (emission, transition, and initial) are handled in the log 
  domain for numerical stability. A very low log-probability (LOG_ZERO) is used to represent near-zero probabilities.

The main function, viterbi_decoding, performs the forward pass to compute the maximum likelihood of state sequences 
and then uses backtracking to recover the optimal state path. It supports optional constraints on state durations and 
forbidden/mandatory states, making it versatile for applications such as speech recognition, speaker diarization, or any 
sequential decision-making tasks that require constrained decoding.

This file has been updated for compatibility with numpy>=1.24 and is part of the pyannote core project.

          emission : numpy.ndarray, shape (n_samples, n_states)
              The log-probabilities for each state at each observation (E[t, i] is the emission log-probability
              of sample t for state i).
          transition : numpy.ndarray, shape (n_states, n_states)
              The log-probabilities of transitioning from one state to another (T[i, j] is the transition log-probability
              from state i to state j).
          initial : optional, numpy.ndarray, shape (n_states,)
              The initial log-probabilities for each state. If not provided, a uniform distribution is assumed.
          consecutive : optional, int or numpy.ndarray, shape (n_states,)
              The minimum number of consecutive observations that each state must persist.
              A value of 1 indicates no constraint. This is used to expand the state space to enforce duration constraints.
          constraint : optional, numpy.ndarray, shape (n_samples, n_states)
              A matrix specifying state constraints at each time step:
                  - 0: no constraint,
                  - 1: state is forbidden,
                  - 2: state is forced.
                  
      Returns:
          numpy.ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
              The most probable sequence of states after applying the constrained Viterbi decoding.
      
      The function adjusts the emission, transition, initial, and constraint matrices by duplicating states to satisfy the
      minimum consecutive constraints. It then performs a forward pass to compute the optimal path probabilities, followed by 
      backtracking to recover the best state sequence, and finally maps the duplicated state indices back to the original states.
